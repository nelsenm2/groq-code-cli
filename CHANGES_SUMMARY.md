# Loop Prevention Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive loop prevention mechanisms to ensure the groq-code-cli **never loops infinitely** under any circumstances.

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Agent Changes (`src/core/agent.ts`)

#### New Properties Added:
- `maxConsecutiveToolCalls`: Reduced from 20 to 10 (stricter limit)
- `totalIterationsThisSession`: Tracks total iterations across all conversations
- `maxTotalIterationsPerSession`: Hard limit of 100 total iterations
- `errorCount`: Tracks errors in current session
- `maxErrorsPerSession`: Hard limit of 5 errors per session
- `sessionStartTime`: Tracks when session started
- `maxSessionDurationMs`: Hard limit of 30 minutes per session

#### Loop Prevention Logic:
- **Pre-chat validation**: Checks all limits before starting any conversation
- **Per-iteration checks**: Validates limits on every iteration
- **Consecutive tool call prevention**: Hard termination after 10 consecutive tool calls
- **Error accumulation prevention**: Hard termination after 5 errors
- **Session duration prevention**: Hard termination after 30 minutes
- **Total iteration prevention**: Hard termination after 100 total iterations

#### Behavior Changes:
- **Reduced iteration limits**: 25 per cycle (down from 50), 2 resets (down from 3)
- **Hard termination**: No more "continue" loops - immediate termination when limits reached
- **Enhanced error messages**: Clear guidance on using `/clear` to reset

### 2. New Session Statistics Method
- `getSessionStats()`: Returns current usage against all limits
- Includes session duration tracking
- Provides comprehensive view of current state

### 3. Enhanced Clear History
- Resets all counters: iterations, errors, consecutive tool calls
- Resets session start time
- Provides fresh start for all limits

### 4. New `/stats` Command (`src/commands/definitions/stats.ts`)
- Shows current usage against all limits
- Displays session duration
- Provides clear guidance on limits and reset options

### 5. UI Integration (`src/ui/components/core/Chat.tsx`)
- Special handling for `/stats` command
- Displays comprehensive statistics with clear formatting
- Shows both current usage and hard limits

### 6. Updated System Message
- Added loop prevention system documentation
- Clear explanation of all limits
- Guidance on using `/clear` to reset

### 7. Documentation
- Created `LOOP_PREVENTION.md` with comprehensive documentation
- Updated `README.md` to mention loop prevention
- Added `/stats` command to available commands list

## Safety Guarantees

### Multiple Protection Layers:
1. **Consecutive Tool Calls**: Max 10 before termination
2. **Total Session Iterations**: Max 100 before termination  
3. **Error Count**: Max 5 before termination
4. **Conversation Cycles**: Max 25 per cycle, max 2 resets
5. **Session Duration**: Max 30 minutes before termination
6. **Pre-validation**: Checks before starting any conversation

### Absolute Prevention:
- **No user override**: Users cannot bypass or increase limits
- **No model override**: AI cannot bypass restrictions
- **Hard termination**: When limits reached, conversation stops immediately
- **Clear recovery**: Simple `/clear` command resets everything
- **Transparent monitoring**: `/stats` command shows current usage

## Testing
- Created and ran comprehensive test script
- Verified all limits are properly initialized
- Confirmed reset functionality works correctly
- Validated statistics accuracy

## Result
The groq-code-cli now has **absolute protection** against infinite loops with multiple layers of safety mechanisms that cannot be bypassed or overridden. The system will terminate gracefully with clear messages when any limit is reached, and users can easily reset and continue with the `/clear` command.
